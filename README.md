# Data 201

This repository is a compilation of all of my completed projects from my Introduction to Data Science Class (Data 201), taken during my Sophomore year (Spring 2023). Prior to this class I had no experience with these models/ skills.

The course description is as follows: 
"In this course, students will learn the fundamentals of data processing and modeling in the context of Data Science.  Emphasis will be placed on careful planning and deliberate decision-making when working with data and building models.  Programming will be done in the Python language, and we will be making extensive use of the scikit-learn collection (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/).

Throughout this course students will be introduced to a variety of supervised and unsupervised machine-learning techniques including various methods for regression, classification, and clustering. By the end of the course, students are not expected to be an expert on any particular technique, but should exhibit a solid high-level understanding of the goals of each method, be able to determine when a particular type of model is more or less suitable to a real-world problem and, most importantly, demonstrate a keen attention to detail when working with data.

Throughout the course, there will be a very strong emphasis placed on understanding why we are doing what we are doing."
